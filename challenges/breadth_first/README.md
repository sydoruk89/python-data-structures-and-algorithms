# Graphs

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity is O(V+E);
* The Big O space complexity would be  O(V + E), where VV is the number of vertices and EE is the number of edges.
