## Challenge
The function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key, and returns the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

# Approach & Efficiency
In my solution I used array at position with -1 step. In this case time O(log n) and space O(log n).
