# Hash Table

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
* In this challenge I used linked list;
* The Big O time complexity is O(1)
* The Big O space complexity would be O(n).


## API 
* class Hashtable
    * def _hash(self, key)
    * def add(self, key, value)
    * def get(self, key)
    * def contains(self, key)
    * def hash_index(self, key)
