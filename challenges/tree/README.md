# Tree

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Approach & Efficiency
* In this challenge I used recursion;
* The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree is O(h), or O(height);
* The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1).


## API 
* class Node
* class BinaryTree
    - pre_order method
    - in_order method
    - post_order method
* class BST(BinaryTree)
    - add method
    - contains method
