# Graphs get edges

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.


## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity is O(n^2);
* The Big O space complexity would be  O(1)
