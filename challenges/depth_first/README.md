# Graphs depth-first

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order..


## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity is O(V+E);
* The Big O space complexity would be  O(V + E), where VV is the number of vertices and EE is the number of edges.
