# FizzBuzz Tree

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.
Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
* In this challenge I used recursion;
* The Big O time complexity is O(h), or O(height);
* The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1).


## API 
* class Node
* class BinaryTree
* def fizz_buzz(value)
* def fizz_buzz_tree(tree)
    - def recursive(current)
