# Queue with two Stacks

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

## Approach & Efficiency
* PseudoQueue - initialization of the PseudoQueue class with one existing Stack and one empty Stack.
* enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
