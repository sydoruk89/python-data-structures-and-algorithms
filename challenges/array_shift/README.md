# Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

# Approach & Efficiency
In my solution I created the empty array and found a middle index. Then I appended 0 - middle index element, middle elemend and from middle to the end elements. In this case time were O(n) and space O(n).
