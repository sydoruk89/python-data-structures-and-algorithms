# Tree intersection

## Authors: Roman Sydoruk

## Challenge
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters. \
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
* The Big O time complexity is O(n+m);
* The Big O space complexity would be O(n+m).
* Used Queue to compare nodes


    
## Solution for find max value
